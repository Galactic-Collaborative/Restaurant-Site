Founded in Jackson, Wyoming on June 24th 1923 by Josiah Goodmen.
Loved adventuring in Yellowstone but got seperated from the group one day.
He spend a week fighting for his life. He needed to kill several animals and roast their flesh on a fire.
It was then he got a much deeper appreciation for meat.
When he was found, he immediately started working on a restaurant in Jackson.
A week later, the restaurant was founded. It was in the basement of his grandma's house. This was of course not an ideal location, hence not many guests showed up.
Josiah did not stop at this set back, he invested in a local newspaper advertisement. This was one of the best things he could have done.
In the middle of the Roaring Twenties, a lot of people were dining out all the time, so when they discovered a new restaurant, it was only a matter of time before they showed up.
A shower of positive reviews resulted in the expansion of the untitled restaurant.
When searching for a new venue, Josiah realized he could incorporate his other passion for adventuring into his company.
His new venue was therefore themed after the yellowstone national park.


When Josiah was a young kid, he would go out with his father to explore the nearby Yellowstone park. This started his passion for the park. When his father was asked to join the army and was deployed to fight in the great war, he often spend time in the park alone.
One day, when he was walking with a group of friends, he got lost and could not find his way back on one of the main paths. Josiah fought for his live in the wilderness, using his knife to kill for food. It was this moment, Josiah realized meat was great!
