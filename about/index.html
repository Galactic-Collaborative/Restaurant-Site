                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The American Steakhouse company has existed for nearly a
                    century. During these years, we have experienced quite a lot
                    of things. Please join us as we navigate through our
                    history, starting with Josiah Goodmen's founding of the
                    American Steakhouse.

                        When Josiah was a young kid, he would go out with his
                        father to explore the nearby Yellowstone park. This
                        started his passion for the park. When his father was
                        asked to join the army and was deployed to fight in the
                        great war, he often spend time in the park alone.

                    <p>
                        One day, when he was walking with a group of friends, he
                        got lost and could not find his way back on one of the
                        main paths. Josiah fought for his live in the
                        wilderness, using his knife to kill for food. It was
                        this moment, Josiah realized the meat he hunted was
                        actually really tasty!

                    <p>
                        After a couple of days, Josiah saw the interstate from a
                        mountain top nearby and walked towards it. A stranger
                        generously lifted him back to his home in Jackson where
                        Josiah immediately started working on a business.

                        It started from his grandma's basement, which is a huge
                        downgrade compared to
                        <a href="#restaurantBuilt" class="plotpoint__link">

                        Josiah was allowed to use the kitchen, which he used to
                        full potential. On the opening day, before going to the
                        market to buy fresh meat, he submitted an ad in a local
                        newspaper. Because of the Roaring Twenties, the
                        advertisement was no mistake: the basement was full in
                        no time. This encouraged Josiah to expand his business.

                        He started his search for the ideal place. Josiah knew
                        it had to be somewhere, where it felt home. As Josiah
                        was a bit of an adventurer, he chose a place near the
                        Yellowstone National Park. Josiah did fear that being
                        too far out of town could interfere with his business,
                        but he was proven wrong three weeks later, when the
                        establishment we are still using today, was built.

                        In the legacy of Josiah we are always looking to expand
                        our business and searching for the best possible
                        ingredients for our dishes. As Josiah himself searched
                        the continents and the worlds oceans to get the meat and
                        seafood he wants to serve, we will continue to do the
                        same. While also searching for the opportunity to bring
                        our restaurants to you so you can enjoy your steak on
                        the beach somewhere!
