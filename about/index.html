                    When Josiah was a young kid, he would go out with his father
                    to explore the nearby Yellowstone park. This started his
                    passion for the park. When his father was asked to join the
                    army and was deployed to fight in the great war, he often
                    spend time in the park alone.

                    One day, when he was walking with a group of friends, he got
                    lost and could not find his way back on one of the main
                    paths. Josiah fought for his live in the wilderness, using
                    his knife to kill for food. It was this moment, Josiah
                    realized the meat he hunted was actually really tasty!

                    After a couple of days, Josiah saw the interstate from a
                    mountain top nearby and walked towards it. A stranger
                    generously lifted him back to his home in Jackson where
                    Josiah immediately started working on a business.

                    It started from his grandma's basement, which is a huge
                    downgrade compared to
                    <a href="#restaurantBuilt"> Josiah's current restaurant</a>
                    Josiah was allowed to use the kitchen, which he used to full
                    potential. On the opening day, before going to the market to
                    buy fresh meat, he submitted an ad in a local newspaper.
                    Because of the Roaring Twenties, the advertisement was no
                    mistake: the basement was full in no time. This encouraged
                    Josiah to expand his business.

                    He started his search for the ideal place. Josiah knew it
                    had to be somewhere, where it felt home. As Josiah was a bit
                    of an adventurer, he chose a place near the Yellowstone
                    National Park. Josiah did fear that being too far out of
                    town could interfere with his business, but he was proven
                    wrong three weeks later, when the establishment we are still
                    using today, was built.
