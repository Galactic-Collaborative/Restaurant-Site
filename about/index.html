                    When Josiah was a young kid, he would go out with his father
                    to explore the nearby Yellowstone park. This started his
                    passion for the park. When his father was asked to join the
                    army and was deployed to fight in the great war, he often
                    spend time in the park alone.

                    lost and could not find his way back on one of the main
                    paths. Josiah fought for his live in the wilderness, using
                    his knife to kill for food. It was this moment, Josiah
                    realized the beef he hunted was actually really tasty!
